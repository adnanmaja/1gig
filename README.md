# Mahasiswa Classifier 

First time trying Object-Oriented Programming. This is a simple command-line Python project to input, store, and evaluate student data (`mahasiswa`)

I build this right after finishing [freeCodeCamp’s 4-hour Python course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw) with minimal guidance. Tbh i think i spent too much time and effort on this


## 🔍 What does it do?
- Input data for multiple students
- Automatically classify:
  - High-achievers (IPK ≥ 3.5)
  - Students under probation (skors)
- Print a full list or only the “smart” students
- Simple input validation
- Built using classes and object instances
